### Radians and degrees

`radians = degrees * Math.PI / 180`
`degrees = radians * 180 / Math.PI`


## Trigonometry functions
ABC
acb = 90deg;
bac = 30deg;
AB - hypotenuse = 4
BC - opposite = 2

### Sine
The *sin* of an angle is the ratio of the lengths of the side of the triangle opposite the angle and the hypotenuse.
```
sin(bac) = AB/BC = Math.sin(30 * Math.PI / 180) = 0.5
```

### Cosine
*Cosine* is defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg of an angle to the hypotenuse.
```
sin(bac) = AC/BC = Math.cos(30 * Math.PI / 180) = 0.87
```

### Tangent
*Tangent* is the relationship of the opposite leg to the adjacent.
```
tan(bac) = BC/AC = Math.cos(30 * Math.PI / 180) = 0.578
```
